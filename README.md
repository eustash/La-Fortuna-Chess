# La-Fortuna-Chess
This chess game is designed to run on the LaFortuna board provided by the University.

It is a regular game of chess that can be played by 2 human opponents. 
To move the cursor across the board use the North/East/South/West buttons.
To select the desired piece press the central button. 
The game follows the normal rules of chess. 
Currently the checkmate is not implemented. However, when one player is in a checkmate position the game won't allow any move since no other move is valid.
